# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a fun Python game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints to guide the player ("Too low!" or "Too high!") until they guess the correct number. It also keeps track of the number of attempts taken to find the correct guess.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Provides feedback to help players adjust their guesses:
  - "Too low!" if the guess is less than the number.
  - "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the number.
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
- Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric guesses) with helpful messages.

## How to Play

1. Run the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py
